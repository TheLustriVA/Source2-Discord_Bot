## Overview

Source 2 is the successor to the Kenneth persona-bot controller, and will test-bed a new architecture to allow for
operations outside of Discord.

Again, Source 2 will take on the every-day role of chatbot, but will be able to organise the others and engage in
commercial and political activities.
